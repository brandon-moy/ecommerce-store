# eCommerce Store

A front end eCommerce store that utilizing product information/data from the admin dashboard to populate the content.

## ðŸ¤” Why I built this?

I have some interest in eCommerce and online store so I wanted to try to build one. Instead of creating one where users can post their own items as a marketplace, I wanted this to be more like a singular shop that allows a user to control it via an external hub that also includes analytics. This is the front-end side of the shop and the admin dashbaord can be visited <a href="https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-admin">here</a>

## Getting Started

Things you will need:

- The <a href="https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-admin">eCommerce-Admin</a> application set up and running

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-store.git
```

2. Install dependencies with Node Package Manager

```
npm install
```

3. Copy the .env files from the .env.example in the root

4. Update the .env values

After you create a new store, copy the url listed in eCommerce Admin dashboard with the storeId and use that to update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

If in development, the url should look like `http://localhost:3000/api/{storeId}`

5. Start up the development server

```
npm run dev
```

6. Open the project in the browser at localhost:3001! (This should be 3001 because you need to be running the ecommerce-admin which should be running on :3000)
